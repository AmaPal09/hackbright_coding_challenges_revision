# Given two already-sorted lists:

# Write a function that returns a new list that is the sorted merge of both of 
# them. For the above lists, our result would be:


# It would be easy to do this by just using Pythonâ€™s built-in sort method, 
# like this:
# >>> out = a + b
# >>> out.sort()

# However, this would have the runtime of O(n log n), where n is the combined 
# length of a and b. You can get a much better runtime by exploiting the fact 
# that both of the input lists are already sorted.

# Your challenge is to implement sort_ab where the runtime is O(a + b) (where a 
#     and b are the lengths of those lists, respectively).
